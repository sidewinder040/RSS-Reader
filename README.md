## To Do Items

1) Feed Object for multiple feed sources capability.
2) Vector of feeds. Config file to store feeds.
3) Store feeds to a file.
4) Maybe add fmt library for better feed formating (especially links).

## Ideas

Summary of headlines with item ID
Display description of item ID, then usse the ID No. to display further details.
Scoring of Feeds to prioritise favourite sources
Add a limit feature, by number of items or frome the last n days.
